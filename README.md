Bookmarklets to be used across the web.
How to use bookmarkets: 
1. Right click on any of your bookmarks and press "Add Page"

3. Enjoy!


All Bookmarklets and their uses:

TAB CLOAK: Cloaks the name of a tab with whatever you choose, and has a customisable icon.

BLOOKET SET GOLD: Sets the amount of gold you have in Blooket. (only works for some blooket games)

DESTROY SITE: Use arrow keys to move and space to shoot. Fly a plane and destroy things to get points.

FLASHLIGHT: Makes the page dark and turns your mouse into a flashlight. (may cause lag, refresh page to stop)

3-D PAGE: Makes a page 3-D with customisable settings.

INVERT PAGE: Inverts a page. Useful for sites without dark mode. (click again to disable)

PIANO: Adds a piano to any page, keys = keys.

TEST CHEAT: Press this on a test to get answers.

Fun Fact: Although it's super laggy, 3-D page and destroy site work together.
